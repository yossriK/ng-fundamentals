use angular cli to create a new angular project, complete with configs to get your app ready for production. can get cli using npm install -g @angular/cli

use : ng new 'template name' to create a new an template for our angular project

angular.json : have some configs for our web packing....
and package json(tells you what dependencies you got) ~ this sign would mean the approximate version ( means would include other batch)
in src: app folder: most of our coding in
	assets folder: statics stuff like our images ...
{ there was some stuff to lock json files and the packages but I could care less at this point}

--- Angular 1 vs angular 2
angular 1 is now referred to as angular js
angulra 2 is simply angular

angular js is MVC architecture/framework where you have view/template that relates to controllers that exposes other mdoesl that represent data
angulra you have component that is one to one with template; you still got mdoels to represent data. component in angular can be thought of as directive in angyular
that get html and logic all together  1 but it was more cohesive and felt cluncky


angular app is bootstrapped
    hierarchical component tree have at its top app component, ==> this got the tempalte, styling and ts file.
    bootstrapping starts with the main.ts file that is linked at angular.json file (check main property), main.ts loaded when app starts, in there I link to appcomponent.ts, and
    in the modules I bootstrap app component as well, double check those sir. but how do I display component??

    look in app.component.ts, it got the selector that is refered in index.html. indexhtml loads first then this gets appcomponent



==-- App module: 
    when adding component, pipe or directive you should add them in declration sectiuon 
    services are added as provider,
    in imports you add other external providers and they become available thru the app I guess 



===-- how to use static assets in our files
    go add images in the assets folder
    linking here works as I am referncing the assets/images folder in our angular.json file that will be included in our app bundle(tells our webpack to do so )
    these were in the "assets" array that you can put images or icons, for scripts lets say there is "scripts" you can put your stuff there 
    I got some new packages installed, then I just refer them into our angular json file 

---=== 
getting scss styling from external package, what we did was usng a twitter package or so, npm isntall ngf-bootstrap --save 
    this package got ng-bootstrap, and jquery(not needed for anguylar dev but got it here) jquery got some help for our menus



----=== Binging and addings strings to html
{{object}} ==> this is interpolation htat represents oen way binding. Angular will look for that object in the component
we use thsi /$ to escape the dollar sign in a html if it is string literal: like html in the compoent itself usign ``
[input parameter in the reciever componet]=(member in our component, the sender)

---== pass data from parent component to child component
we importt Input from angular, and put @Input infront of the varible that we expect to be sent from a component to another 
<event-thumbnail [event]="event1"></event-thumbnail>
[input parameter in the reciever componet]=(member in our component, the sender)

---== pass data from child component to parent8 component
